# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

Step 1 : Data Sourcing (Public Data, Private Data)
Step 2 : Data Cleaning 
- 2.1 Handling Misssing Values
- -- Dropping Columns Which has more that 90% data missing
- -- Droping Rows which has missing value
- -- Replacing Missing Value by mean/ median / Mode  ( Imputation )
- -- Forward and Backwar Filling
- 2.2 Feature Scaling of the data (Standardization / Normalization ) ( Library: sklearn.preprocessing )
- Divide All values by Maximum Value
- Standard Scalar (Standardization)
- Min-Max Scaler  (Normalization)
- 2.3 Outlier Treatment
- -- For Detection Use Boxplot, Histograms, Scatter Plot, Z-Score, Inter Quartile Range
- -- Treatment - Remove them or use the model which are not affected by outlier like KNN, SVM, DT, Naive Bayes

- 2.4 Handle Invalid Value
